|--------|--------|------|-------------------|------|
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | ≤ 0.1 | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1 - 0.25 | > 0.25 |
| **FID** (First Input Delay) | ≤ 100ms | ≤ 100ms | 100 - 300ms | > 300ms |
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | ≤ 2.5s | ≤ 2.5s | 2.5 - 4.0s | > 4.0s |
| **FCP** (First Contentful Paint) | ≤ 1.8s | ≤ 1.8s | 1.8 - 3.0s | > 3.0s |
| **TTFB** (Time to First Byte) | ≤ 800ms | ≤ 800ms | 800 - 1800ms | > 1800ms |

## Image Optimization Results

### Before Optimization (PNG)
- `avatar.png`: 362KB
- `github-mark.png`: 6.4KB  
- `github-mark-white.png`: 4.8KB
- **Total**: 373.2KB

### After Optimization (WebP)
- `avatar.webp`: 43KB (88% reduction)
- `github-mark.webp`: 2.6KB (59% reduction)
- `github-mark-white.webp`: 2.3KB (52% reduction)
- **Total**: 47.9KB (87% reduction)

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### ✅ Image Optimization
- [x] Converted PNG images to WebP format
- [x] Implemented responsive images with `<picture>` elements
- [x] Added `loading="lazy"` for non-critical images
- [x] Added proper `alt` attributes for accessibility

### ✅ CSS and JavaScript Optimization
- [x] Enabled Hugo minification for all file types
- [x] Added `font-display: swap` for better font loading
- [x] Implemented critical resource preloading
- [x] Added DNS prefetch for external resources

### ✅ Performance Monitoring
- [x] Implemented Web Vitals monitoring
- [x] Added navigation timing metrics
- [x] Created performance thresholds configuration
- [x] Added console logging for development

### ✅ Resource Optimization
- [x] Preload critical CSS (`custom.css`)
- [x] Preload critical images (`avatar.webp`)
- [x] DNS prefetch for external domains (unpkg.com, github.com)
- [x] Optimized font loading with `font-display: swap`

## Expected Performance Improvements

1. **Image Loading**: 87% reduction in image file sizes
2. **Font Loading**: Improved with `font-display: swap`
3. **Resource Loading**: Faster with preloading and DNS prefetch
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Lighthouse audit (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile device testing (iOS, Android)
- [ ] Network throttling tests (3G, 4G)
- [ ] Accessibility testing with axe DevTools
- [ ] HTML/CSS validation with W3C validators

## Next Steps

1. Run comprehensive Lighthouse audits
2. Test on various devices and browsers
3. Validate HTML and CSS
4. Test accessibility compliance
5. Document final performance metrics
